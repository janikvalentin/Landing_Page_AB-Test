## Analyze AB Test Results

This is my project on analyzing AB Test Results as part of the
[Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

### Overview

This is a procejt on probability, AB-Testing and regressions.
The goal of the project is to assess, whether a company's new web page leads
to a higher user conversion rate or not.

Probabilities for different scenarios are calculated to explore the dataset.
A standard t-test and a proportions z-test are used to test hypotheses.
Finally, a logistic regression model is implemented to test correlation.

### Technologies used

- Python
- libraries: numpy, pandas, random, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy, patsy
- the report is written in jupyter notebooks
