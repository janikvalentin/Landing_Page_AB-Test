## Project Overview

This is a project on probability, AB-Tests and regressions.
The goal of the project is to assess, whether an e-commerce company's new web page leads
to a higher user conversion rate or not.

Probabilities for different scenarios are calculated to explore the dataset.
A standard t-test and a proportions z-test are used to test hypotheses.
Finally, a logistic regression model is implemented to test correlation.

The project is one requirement in achieving the
